<p align="center">
 This fork was <b>made from an already archived and deprecated version</b>!<br>
 See the implications of the original author below.
</p> 
<p>
 Credits to the original author of this library, which allows very easy implementation into projects.<br>
 Unfortunately it does not allow to make adjustments to the User Interface. 
 (The original sources contain only a gzipped HTML page.)
</p>
 Extended the AsyncElegantOTA.<b>begin()</b> signature to have parameters for the HTML page, it's size and a flag wether the page is zipped.<br>
 (Works still with the original page as a default, see examples).
</p>
<p>
 Provided a <b>plain HTML/Javascript page as an alternate UI</b> which may easily adopted to specific needs.<br>
 (Notice: This UI does currently not provide an MD5 checksum, which is recognized by the library and MD5 checksum verification is skipped.)
